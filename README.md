This is my work day calendar! Keep track of your own events by typing in the text box and saving it! The colors display if the event is in the past with grey, present with red, and future with green. I  also added an extra Add or Subract button if you want to manually see how the calendar will look at certain times.

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
